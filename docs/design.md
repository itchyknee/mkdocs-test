# Design in the NHSBSA

> Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. **Design is how it works.**

## What is design

There are lots of different kinds of design, within the NHSBSA we have:



*   Service Designers (link)
*   Interaction Designers (link)
*   Content Designers (link)

What they all have in common, is that the designer takes time to understand the problem they’re faced with from a range of perspectives, before they create a solution. The Design Council’s Double Diamond model is a visual diagram showing these design stages.

The Double Diamond shows the importance of taking time to understand the problem before designing solutions.

Each diamond shape illustrates the process of creating or exploring many possible ideas before refining these to the best idea.The first diamond does this to confirm the problem, and the second to design the solution.
