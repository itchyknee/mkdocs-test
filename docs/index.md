## About us

**C**ollaborative

**A**dventurous

**R**eliable

**E**nergetic

“a catalyst for better health”

“the delivery partner of choice for the NHS”

We aim to be an organisation that delivers by focusing on users, introducing new ways of working and using technology & insight as an enabler for change.

This is our playbook. It’s a guide to how we design user-centred services at the NHSBSA. It’s an agreed set of core ideas and intentions to ensure we build the **right thing**, before building the **thing right**.

It does not replace the [Government Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), it is meant to add to, support and clarify how we use standards within the NHSBSA.


### “Digital mission statement”- what is our shared goal as a department?

## Ways of working


### Principles

All of our services should meet the [Service Standard,](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) whether or not the service goes to GDS assessment. This is a key feature of building the **right thing**.


### User-Centred Agile ways of working

All our services should be design-led. We use user research to understand our users’ problems, validate assumptions about our services, and iterate our designs using prototypes to address users needs.

We then use user stories to help communicate the user needs to the wider team, aid developers and to release incremental value with each sprint.



*   Discovery
*   Alpha
*   Beta
*   Live and continuous improvement

Just because a project goes live, doesn’t mean the service stops being researched, iterat


### Designing

Our human-centered design process is grounded in the principles of Design Thinking. It's the driving force behind our projects and teams. Designers keep this process alive by helping our teams understand user problems and needs. Together, we collaboratively and continuously ideate, build, and learn.



*   [Design in the NHSBSA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlIStuF9oVKbU4ouuhjyBrieFKDlB_XCNGO6ulnvLg4/edit?usp=sharing)
*   Test Assumptions, Get Validation, and Eliminate Business Risk
*   Research Frames the Problem or Opportunity We’re Solving For
*   Test Usability Frequently
*   What is Interaction Design?
*   What is Service Design?
*   What is visual design?


### Prototyping



*   Quick and basic to get ideas and designs in front of users
*   Prototyping in HTML and CSS
*   What a prototype is not *hint* it’s not production ready code
*   Where do they lines between prototyping end and production start


### Research

Anyone conducting research interviews, even with NHSBSA colleagues, need to get complete ethics training and gain consent before starting



*   Ethics and informed consent
*   Researcher safety
*   Safeguarding participant data and GDPR


### Planning

One of our primary process goals is to make frequent, small releases of our working software. We do through frequent communication and regular iterations on a service.



*   Processes need to adapt to the needs of the product and team
*   Advisors help enable our project teams for success
*   Daily standups build trust and maintain momentum
*   Nothing beats in-person communication
*   Manage priorities and visualize progress with a lightweight process
*   Meet weekly to discuss successes, failures, and future plans


### Choose Platforms

Early in a project, we have to decide which platforms we'll use. Which platform depends on our ideas for solving these users' problems. After considering what's best for users, the best tools for us have a strong community, make us happy, and help us create and iterate quickly.



*   Browser Testing and Support

### Developing

Our development practices are evolving, drawing inspiration from agile, human centred and clean coding techniques, first detailed in Kent Beck's classic[ Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321278658), Gerald Weinberg's[ The Psychology of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0932633420) and [Robert Martin’s Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0132350882).

### Production

We live in a magical modern era where many problems have already been solved for us. We focus on the core product as much as possible and outsource operations as much as possible to external services.



*   Continuous Delivery
*   Domain Names and DNS
*   Error Tracking
*   Hosting
*   Log Collection
*   Payment Processing
*   Performance Monitoring
*   Production Checklist
*   SSL Certificates
*   Transactional Email
*   KPI’s

### Acceptance Tests


### Measuring

The difficult part of measuring is deciding what to track. Dave McClure's[ AARRR framework](https://tbot.io/metrics-for-pirates) provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.
